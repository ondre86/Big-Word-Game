# [The Big Word Game](https://thebigwordgame.com)
## An _upbeat_ game designed to test and sharpen players' vocabulary skills
The Big Word Game is a single page web application that users can connect to and play over the internet.

It's based on a game that my mother, _an English teacher with over 20 years of experience_, would play with my siblings and I on long road trips.
