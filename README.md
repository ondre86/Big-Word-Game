# [The Big Word Game](https://thebigwordgame.com)
## An _upbeat_ game designed to test and sharpen players' vocabulary skills
The Big Word Game is a single page web application that users can connect to and play over the internet.

It's based on a game that my mother, _an English teacher with over 20 years of experience_, would play with my siblings and I on long road trips. 

**Why did I create and design this app?**
- To strengthen my coding, design, and user interaction skills
- It was personal and engaging for me to actualize one of my childhood games
- I felt a need to provide more engaging ***educational*** experiences catered to all ages
  
  - It's a fun way for children to test and expand their vocabulary
  - It's also a fun way for older people to retain their mental acuity

**Challenges I faced during development**
- Choosing a JS framework that made the most sense for the project
- Leaning new skills and incorporating new technologies
  
  - Sass, Vue.JS, Node.JS, Express, WebSockets, HTTP Headers + Security, 3rd party JS Libraries, Using REST APIs, Asynchronous JavaScript, Railway, Git + GitHub, NPM
- Understanding full-stack development (how front-ends & back-ends communicate)
- Understanding deployments and environment variables
- Constant user interface revisions during solo and focus group testing
- Bug finding and fixing (locally & in production)
- Compression and file-size management
