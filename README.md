# [The Big Word Game](https://thebigwordgame.com)
## An _upbeat_ game designed to test and sharpen players' vocabulary skills
The Big Word Game is a single page web application that users can connect to and play over the internet.

It's based on a game that my mother, _an English teacher with over 20 years of experience_, would play with my siblings and I on long road trips. 

Players have 15 seconds to enter a word that starts with the target letter shown on their screen **and** that word must contain **three** or more syllables.
There are a few other minor rules that keep the game clean and competitive, as well.

After a successful word is played, the the word is added to your "used" list, and its definition is shown on screen.

Players can play until they get 3 strikes, or the round ends.

## Use Cases
#### Learning New Words 
- Teachers playing on their big classroom screen, oscillating between student participation and the teachers introducing new words to the children
- Parents playing alongside their children at home, either as a leisure or homeschooling activity, doing the same as above
#### Having Fun
- Children playing together in school, with solo games during quiet time and multiplayer games during fun time
- Teens and adults playing against each other online for easy, low-stakes competition, and a change of pace from social media apps
#### Staying Fresh
- Adults and seniors playing often as a way to keep their brains active and their vocabularies sharp
